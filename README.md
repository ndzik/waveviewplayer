# WaveViewPlayer #

![screenshot](res/images/lots_of_tracks.png)*Linux Version v0.1*

This is a restart of another WaveViewPlayer-Project I did. It has the same
codebase as before but some tweaks here and there.

WVP is a cross-platform mp3/wav audiofile viewer. It is supposed to give
creators and others a visual overview for their audiofiles.

Imagine yourself editing a video and relying on a ton of soundfiles/sfx.
They are often labeled the same way "xxx-splash.mp3" and hundreds of variations
with the same suffix.
The idea is, that humans often are faster in recognizing patterns/images than
bland text. If you can imagine what I am talking about, this might be an
application for you.
